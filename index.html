            Welcome to Kvelíere, the blog, portfolio, and playground of Elya. You'll find an assortment of
            links to my various projects; I write, program, study computational linguistics, construct languages of my own, and
            generally nerd-out about a lot of stuff such as history, mathematics, and a great many other things.
            I'm likely to publish articles discussing any of my honestly quite ecclectic interests. I'm especially fascinated by
            linguistics, history, programming, literature, and any combination thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, I'm busy finishing up a master's degree in computational linguistics at Indiana University. In
            particular, my  interest is in developing technologies for marginalized languages. I've written papers on natural
            language processing pipelines for Standard and Classical Tibetan and recently worked with the Belgian National
            Institute of Criminalistics and Criminology (NICC) on a project employing large language models (LLMs) and knowledge
            graphs.

            While I've done work with LLMs and generative AI, I think that such tools need to be heavily regulated.
            They are quickly diluting public sources of information and generally muddying the waters so that good knowledge 
            is increasingly hard to find. Unless you like living in a world where your politics, your art, and the validity of
            your health insurance claims are determined by AI, we need to clamp down on its usage today.
            
            In addition to Tibetan, I have studied Spanish and Japanese. During the summer of 2024, I travelled to Nepal,
            to Kathmandu, to study Tibetan at the Rangjung Yeshe Institute via the Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS)
            Fellowship. I also received FLAS to fund my ongoing research on digital technologies for Tibetan.

            <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I program in C++ and Python, for the most part, but I have experience with C#, Javascript, and a few other languages.
            Much of my programming experience is in the realm of graphics programming and machine learning. On a less formal level,
            I particularly enjoy coding games, usually similar to those I like to play: roguelikes (of the Nethack variety), sims
            (in the vein of Dwarf Fortress), and grand strategy games (such as Crusader Kings 2). You can likely glean more of
            my personality from this list than I'd like to admit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Constructing languages is a bit of an obsession of mine: most my work here goes to naturalistic languages,
            but I've toyed around with engineered and personal languages. I recently put together an auxiliary language which
            attempts to combine phonological minimalism with a simple grammar while drawing on the twenty most-spoken languages
            around the world for its lexicon; it is known as <a href="https://www.kveliere.com/pdfs/mitaeme-primer.pdf">Mitaeme</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have written up this site myself in order to have more control over its aesthetic and function. This was
            inspired in no small part by a number of personal and professional blogs such as <a href="https://s.ai/">S.ai</a>,
            <a href="https://www.gwern.net">Gwern.net</a>, and <a href="https://www.lingweenie.org/">Lingweenie.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I'd like to say thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy.

                                                This script is fairly heavily influenced by Blackletter, the Tibetan Script (Uchen), and Hanzi (Chinese)
                                                characters (mostly in terms of its underlying structure). Various phonetic and semantic 
                                                components combine to indicate the various words which compound to form the endonym for the language.

                                            it translates to "Black Dog," something of a reference to Samuel Johnson's use of the term:
                                            "the black dog I hope always to resist, and in time to drive...."
